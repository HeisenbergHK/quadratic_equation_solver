# quadratic_equation_solver
This is a program I write in python the can solve Quadratic Equations

You can input a, b and c to form a equation in this form " aX^2 + bX + c = 0 ".

The program will solve the equation and print the answers(s) in a neatly formated text in termainal.

If you found any bug or any feedback I`m glad to hear them
